## Title

Build a search functionality to your Django Application using Docker and Postgres SQL


## Intro

In modern web apps, search functionality is a given to have. Therefore in this post, we would be building a basic search functionality and then scale it up to a more complex search functionality to meet your needs. 

We would be using Postgres SQL as our database as it provides additional features that are supported by Django which other databases that Django supports do not provide.

Also, we would be bootstrap our project with docker, this saves us time from downloading and then configuring Postgres and Django to your operating system needs.

Finally, I do expect a basic understanding of Django as we would be building a simple quote taking application to test our search functionality.


## Objectives

By the end of this post you should be able to:

1. Start a Django and Postgres project with Docker.
2. Add basic search functionality to your app.
3. Add a full-text search to your app.
4. Implement stemming and ranking of search result.
5. add weights to your search query
